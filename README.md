#  Breast Cancer Classification (Machine Learning)

An end-to-end **machine learning project** that predicts whether a breast tumor is **Benign (0)** or **Malignant (1)**.  
Includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation** using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve survival rates.  
This project applies ML techniques to classify tumors and assist in early diagnosis.

##  Dataset
- **Source**: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset]([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data))  
- **Samples**: 569  
- **Features**: 30 numeric features (e.g., `radius_mean`, `texture_mean`)  
- **Target**: Diagnosis â†’ `0` = Benign, `1` = Malignant  

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis
- Benign vs Malignant distribution (~60% vs ~40%)  
- Strong feature correlations (`radius_mean`, `perimeter_mean`)  
- Visualizations: histograms, boxplots, heatmaps  

---

##  Feature Engineering
- Dropped irrelevant columns (`id`, `Unnamed: 32`)  
- Standardized features with **StandardScaler**  
- Removed highly correlated features (|r| > 0.90)  
- Selected top 10 features via **ANOVA F-test**  
- Applied **PCA** (95%+ variance explained)

##  Models Used
- Logistic Regression (baseline)  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (RBF kernel)

##  Results

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 96.5%    | 95.8%     | 96.2%  | 96.0%    |
| Random Forest       | 98.2%    | 97.9%     | 98.0%  | 98.0%    |
| SVM (RBF Kernel)    | 97.5%    | 97.0%     | 97.3%  | 97.1%    |

Random Forest performed best overall.
